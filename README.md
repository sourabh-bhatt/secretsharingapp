## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sourabh-bhatt/secretsharingapp.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd secretsharingapp`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## How to Run
1. Start the development server: `npm start`
2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

## Project Structure
The project follows a standard React project structure:

```bash
/src
|-- components   # Reusable React components
|-- App.js       # Main entry point for the application
|-- index.js     # Entry file for rendering the React app
</div>
```


## User Authentication System
The user authentication system employs a secure Auth0 by octa which basically runs on OAuth by Google. Registration, login, and password recovery functionalities are implemented using industry best practices.

## Secrets Posting Section
Users can post secrets on the secret screen as shown in home page. Each user is allowed to share one secret message. The secrets of other users are displayed anonymously.

## Responsiveness Across Devices
The application ensures responsiveness across various devices through the use of Tailwind CSS. The layout adapts seamlessly to tablets, desktops, and phones.


## Security Considerations
- Passwords are securely hashed by google, even though they are not shared at all. OAuth is most secure integration.
